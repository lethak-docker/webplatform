# MYSQL
=======

This Docker Image runs Mysql 5.6.

It has been forked from the official Mysql Docker container, with minimal changes:

- set timezone the same as the other containers

- change the user-id/group-id of the mysql user, to ease the sharing of data in mounted volumes

* Run the container

You can run the container with the docker run command :
