LethaK's Docker images for a webplatform
============================================================

This repository contains all the Docker images used in our development stacks.

This is the base repository for all Docker images hosted on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lethak/).

You should read carefully all images' Readme file in order to understand how to use these images.
 
 
This repository also contains some docker-compose.yml file examples [here](compose/).

The compose folder contains a [Readme](compose/README.md) that you also should read very carefully in order to understand how to build your own stack.
